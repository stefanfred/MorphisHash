## MorphisHash

MorphisHash uses [ShockHash](https://github.com/ByteHamster/ShockHash.git) to construct even more space efficient MPHFs.
Choose ws such that b=n-ws to obtain results as presented in the paper.
Anything else is just like in ShockHash.
A [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10161) of the MorphisHash paper is now available.
MorphisHash is integrated into [the MPHF benchmark project](https://github.com/ByteHamster/MPHF-Experiments).
